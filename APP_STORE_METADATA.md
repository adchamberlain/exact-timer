Set your watch to the exact second with ExactTimer.

ExactTimer syncs with official NIST atomic clocks to display the precise time, accurate to the millisecond. Perfect for setting mechanical watches, automatic timepieces, or any clock that needs to be perfectly synchronized.

WHY YOU NEED THIS
Your iPhone's clock is usually close, but not exact. ExactTime bypasses your device clock entirely and syncs directly with the same atomic clocks that define official U.S. time.

HOW IT WORKS
• Connects to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) time servers
• Uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) for precision synchronization
• Compensates for network latency automatically
• Displays continuously updating time: HH:MM:SS

FEATURES
• Real-time clock display synced to atomic time
• Manual re-sync button for instant refresh
• Shows sync status and connection health
• Displays last successful sync time
• Clean, distraction-free interface
• Retro terminal aesthetic with green-on-black design
• No ads, no tracking, no accounts

PERFECT FOR
• Watch collectors setting mechanical timepieces
• Horology enthusiasts who demand precision
• Anyone who appreciates knowing the exact time
• Photographers needing precise timestamps
• Professionals syncing to official time

TECHNICAL DETAILS
ExactTimer queries multiple NIST time servers using standard NTP protocol:
• time.nist.gov
• time.apple.com
• time-a-wwv.nist.gov
• time-b-wwv.nist.gov

The app calculates network round-trip time and adjusts for latency to provide true atomic time accuracy.

PRIVACY FOCUSED
No personal data collected. No tracking. No ads. Just time.

Set your watch right. ⌚

## Screenshot Recommendations

You'll need screenshots for:
1. **iPhone 6.7" Display** (iPhone 15 Pro Max, 14 Pro Max)
2. **iPhone 6.5" Display** (optional - can reuse 6.7")
3. **iPad Pro 12.9" Display** (if supporting iPad)

### Suggested Screenshots (in order):
1. **Main time display** showing synced atomic time
2. **Sync in progress** showing connection to NIST
3. **Sync complete** showing success status and last sync time
4. **About screen** explaining the app
5. **Splash screen** with app branding

### Tips:
- The green-on-black terminal aesthetic is distinctive — highlight it
- Show the time updating (capture at an interesting time like 12:34:56)
- Consider adding device frames for a polished look
