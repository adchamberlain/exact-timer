# Privacy Policy for ExactTimer

**Last Updated: January 9, 2026**

## Overview

ExactTimer ("the App") is developed by Andrew Chamberlain. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Information We Collect

### We Do NOT Collect Any Personal Data

ExactTimer is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **No personal information** is collected (name, email, etc.)
- **No location data** is collected or used
- **No usage tracking** or analytics
- **No advertising** or ad-related tracking
- **No data sharing** with third parties

## Network Connections

### NTP Time Servers

The App connects to public Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to sync accurate time:

- `time.nist.gov` (NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- `time.apple.com` (Apple)
- `time-a-wwv.nist.gov` (NIST)
- `time-b-wwv.nist.gov` (NIST)

**What is transmitted:** Only standard NTP protocol packets (timestamps) are exchanged. No personal information is sent.

**Why:** To calculate the precise offset between your device clock and official time sources.

## Data Storage

The App stores minimal data locally on your device:
- Time sync offset (to display accurate time)
- Last sync timestamp

This data is:
- Stored only on your device
- Not transmitted anywhere
- Deleted when you uninstall the App

## Children's Privacy

ExactTime does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The App is suitable for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
